Write a method that takes in a positive integer, return the number of 2s between 0 and the input number. 

If the input value given is 13, it should return 2 as the number 2 and 12 are between 0 and 13.

If the input value given is 21, it should return 3 as the number 2,12 and 20 are between 0 and 21.

This question is windows based subsystem design to test the design skills. We are working in a complex system which involves multiple process, DLLs, windows services which will be gets installed on our system with the project. We have to design a logger system for this project where in all the multiple subsystem can use this logger system for their logging activities . 
Design pattern used
 	Statically linked or Dynamically linked?
	How the logger functions are designed (sample signatures)
	How we can improve performance while logging (Think of ETL tracing)

Assume that garbage collector is not there in place or you are implementing a garbage collector for C++. Write the design and sample code for garbage collector implementation 
We have 3 classed and Class A, B, C. object of A uses object B and Object of B uses Object of C. How can we track the object existence and clear memory ?
Answer which I suggested : Write a tree (or Graph?)data structure (Garbage collector is a container class holds this data structure) where each node has multiple paths to reach. If any of the node is not having a path to reach then we can clean that memory. This way the garbage collection will work. Please suggest your design as well.

Need Java Program :

A rectangular plot comprising n*m block ( cement block in shape of a cube) were kept, one block per each cell. the base of 

each block covers one cell completely and its surface is equals to one square meter. cube on adjacent cell are so close 

that there are no gaps between them.due to a heavy rain on the constuction, water is accumulated in the gaps created 

between a group of blocks due to the difference in their heights.

write a program to calculate the volume of water accumulated between the blocks on the constrution.

Input Specifications:

your function must read three arguments i.e plot_length,plot_breadth and block_height
where Output Specifications:
output will be an integer that will depict the volume of water (in cubic metres) accumulated in the puddles due to the 

difference in heights of block.

Need Java code:
 In a Multinational company employees are ordered to seat according to their height in a line. they always choose their 

positions randomly to displeasure their manager. one evening, the employee learn that their strict manager has secretly 

recorded their seating positions from that morning, and that he will be checking their positions in the next moning to 

make sure they are exactly the same.

Each employee only remember one thing from that morning: the number of people to his left that were teller then him. 

there are N employees, each with a different height between 1 to n. using this information you must reconstruct the 

seating arrangement from that morning. this ordering satisfies all four conditions.
For example, there are exactly two employees to the left of the employees with height 1 that are taller then him(heights 4 

and 2). A different ordering,like 4,3,1,2, satisfies some, but not all of the four conditions. in this incorrect ordering, there 

are two employees to the left of employee with height 2 that are taller then him(height 4 and 3), but input states that 

there was only one.
