1-800-CODING-CHALLENGE
Many companies like to list their phone numbers using the letters printed on most
telephones. This makes the number easier to remember for customers. An example may
be 1-800-FLOWERS
This coding challenge is to write a program that will show a user possible matches for a list
of provided phone numbers.
Your program should be a command line application that reads from files specified as
command-line arguments or STDIN when no files are given. Each line of these files will
contain a single phone number.
For each phone number read, your program should output all possible word replacements
from a dictionary. Your program should try to replace every digit of the provided phone
number with a letter from a dictionary word; however, if no match can be made, a single
digit can be left as is at that point. No two consecutive digits can remain unchanged and
the program should skip over a number (producing no output) if a match cannot be made.
Your program should allow the user to set a dictionary with the -d command-line option,
but it's fine to use a reasonable default for your system. The dictionary is expected to have
one word per line.
All punctuation and whitespace should be ignored in both phone numbers and the
dictionary file. The program should not be case sensitive, letting "a" == "A". Output should
be capital letters and digits separated at word boundaries with a single dash (-), one
possible word encoding per line. For example, if your program is fed the number:
! 2255.63
One possible line of output is
! CALL-ME
According to my dictionary.
The number encoding on the phone the program will use is:
DIGIT CHARACTERS
2 A B C
3 D E F
4 G H I
5 J K L
DIGIT CHARACTERS
6 M N O
7 P Q R S
8 T U V
9 W X Y Z

---Question :4---
Our merchants receive "weekly" invoices, following these rules:

- Each Saturday (00:00 UTC) marks the beginning of a new billing period
- Each 1st of a month (00:00 UTC) marks the beginning of a new billing
 period
- Within a year, billing periods are numbered consecutively, starting
 with billing period number 1 on Jan 1

Billing periods can therefore be identified by a year and a period
number.

Task:
-----
Write the following functions:

*) For a given date, return the id of the latest period that ends
 before this date, e.g.

 auto getLatestBillingPeriodId(Date date) -&gt; PeriodId;

*) For a given period id, return the begin and the end date of the
 billing period, e.g.

 auto getDateRange(PeriodId periodId) -&gt; std::pair&lt;Date, Date&gt;;

---Question :18---
Write a java program:

There is plant species (say P) in a desert that has a specific living pattern. A rectangular 

field of the land is divided into squara cell.The land will have R rows and C columns of the 

cell.Each cell will be surrounded by up-to eight neighboring cells(note that the cells at the 

edge of the field will have fewer then eight nuighboring cells). A cell can either be empty

(having no plant in it) or living(having a plant in it).A particular cell is said to have N 

neighbors(1&lt;N&lt;8), if exactly N cells in the neighborhood have living plants.

the plants fallow a certain rules for survival.the rules are as fallows.
1) if a cell with plant s1 to s2 neighbors (1&lt;=s1&lt;=s2&lt;=8), it survives to the next generation. 

i.e. the plant dies if it has less than s1 neighbors or more than s2 neighbors.
2) If an empty cell has B1 to B2 neidhbors (1&lt;=B1&lt;=B2&lt;=8), a new plant takes birth in that cell 

in the next generation.

Input Specification:
theinput will have two arrays, as fallows

1)An integer array: {R,C,S1,S2,B1,B2,G}
where R and C specify size of the field in row and columns respectively, with 1&lt;=R&lt;=2000 and 

1&lt;=C&lt;=2000 s1,s2,B1 and B2 are integers as explained in the survival rules. G is the number of 

generations for wich the simulation has to be run.

2)An integer array specifying intial state of the field: size of the array will be R*c
the data will be expressed in the array as fallows:{E11,E12,E1c,E21,....,E2C,ER1,ERC} where Eij 

is cell in the field at ith row and jth column. Eij can have value 0 or 1. 0 corresponds to 

empty cell and 1 corresponds to living cell.

output specification:
output will be an integer array specifying state of the field at the end of the simulation in 

the same manner as in input.

Examples:

Example 1:
input1: {3,4,2,3,3,3,3}
input2: {0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0}
output : {0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0}

Example 2:
input1: {3,4,2,3,3,3,4}
input2: {0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0}
output: {0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0}

---Question :19---
you are given an MxN matric.Every cell of the matrix has a cost associated. initially you are at(0,0) and you have to reach (M-1,N-1). Question is to find the minimum cost path from (0,0) to (M-1,N-1) and also the minimum cost. From a cell you can only make a move to right cell or down cell or diagonally lower cell.

Input Specification:
Input1: A string array containing rows of the cost matrix as element.
input2: An integer having number of rows in the cost matrix.

For above example, the matrix would be {5#7#2#4,1#8#1#3,6#2#9#5,1#6#2#8} and number of rows would be 4.

output Specification:
The output will be a string containing minimum cost and the path chosen separated by the comma.

For Example , Given the cost matrix

	5 7 2 4
	1 8 1 3 
	6 2 9 5
	1 6 2 8

1) minimum cost value is 5+1+2+2+8=18
2) minimum cost path from (0,0,) to (M-1,N-1) is BDDR

B- for down move
D- Diagonal Move
R- Right move
NA- No solution

Hence your output will be 18,BDDR

method signature:

Print the maximum number of coins that you can collect.

Clarification: you can do as many moves as you wish, the point is to collect maximum number of coins. If you are located at position (a, b) you may jump to position (a+dx, b+dy) for all dx &gt; 0 and dy &gt; 0

@krbchd: Your algorithm may output incorrect values. Suppose there are points (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9) for y coordinates LIS will output 7, 8, 9, however since these points are on the same x axis, you can choose only one of them.

Each line consists of three fields "Student ID," "Subject," and "Marks." "Student ID" and "Marks" are integers and "Subject" is a string that does not contain '|' or newlines. There can be any number of students and up to 6 subjects. The fields are separated by the '|' character. 

Currently, the existing program reads the input and creates an ArrayList&lt;String&gt; from the lines of input. Then it calls a method processData on this ArrayList, and prints the returned data to the output file. Unfortunately, processData currently does not do anything useful - it just returns an empty `Map. 

You have to modify processData to compute the marks scored in each subject by the student with the lowest ID (who has actually appeared for that test). Thus, processData will returns a Map that maps each Subject to the marks scored. In other words, the map will contain each subject name as a key, and the marks scored by the student with the lowest ID as the value for that entry. 

If your program is run with the input given above, it should produce the following output:

Need Java code:
 In a Multinational company employees are ordered to seat according to their height in a line. they always choose their 

positions randomly to displeasure their manager. one evening, the employee learn that their strict manager has secretly 

recorded their seating positions from that morning, and that he will be checking their positions in the next moning to 

make sure they are exactly the same.

Each employee only remember one thing from that morning: the number of people to his left that were teller then him. 

there are N employees, each with a different height between 1 to n. using this information you must reconstruct the 

seating arrangement from that morning.

you are given a int[], the ith element of which represents the number of taller employees to the left of the employee with 

height i (where i is a 1-based index). Return a int[] containing the heights of the employees from left to right in the line.

Note: The input is guaranteed to produce a valid and unique output.

Inputs Specifications:
your function should accept the fallowing inputs:
Input 1: N
Input 2: An array(left[]) of n integers

Output Specifications:
you need to return the int [] containing the heights of the employees from left to right in the line.

Example :
Input:
input 1: 4
input 2: {2,1,1,0}

Output: {4,2,1,3}

Explanation:
Employee of height 1 remembered there were 2 employees taller than him to his left.
Employee of height 2 remembered there were 1 employees taller than him to his left.
Employee of height 3 remembered there were 1 employees taller than him to his left.
Employee of height 4 remembered there were no employees taller than him to his left.
the orginal order from left to right must have been 4,2,13.

this ordering satisfies all four conditions.
For example, there are exactly two employees to the left of the employees with height 1 that are taller then him(heights 4 

and 2). A different ordering,like 4,3,1,2, satisfies some, but not all of the four conditions. in this incorrect ordering, there 

are two employees to the left of employee with height 2 that are taller then him(height 4 and 3), but input states that 

there was only one.

---Question :61---
This class will be given a list of words (such as might be tokenized
 from a paragraph of text), and will provide a method that takes two
 words and returns the shortest distance (in words) between those two
 words in the provided text.
 Example:
 WordDistanceFinder finder = new WordDistanceFinder(Arrays.asList("the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "quick"));
 assert(finder.distance("fox","the") == 3);
 assert(finder.distance("quick", "fox") == 1);
 
 "quick" appears twice in the input. There are two possible distance values for "quick" and "fox":
 (3 - 1) = 2 and (4 - 3) = 1.
 Since we have to return the shortest distance between the two words we return 1.

---Question :62---
Stanford has to select a team of dodgeball players from its class of 2013. There are n students in the class and each student is identified by his/her student ID, which is between 1 and n. The coach has to select K players out of these n students for his team. But there is a twist, if among the K dodgeball players, a player's ID number evenly divides another player's ID number, then there is a high chance of them getting into a fight. The coach will do his best to select the K players so that no pair of players among them will want to fight one another. But if the game turns out to be very popular, this becomes impossible. Complete the function dodgeBall to return the minimum size of K at which it becomes impossible to choose a dodgeball team that has no fighting?

Input Format:
One line of text, containing the size of the class of 2013, n

Constraints:
1 &lt;= n &lt;= 5,000,000,000
n is guaranteed to be an even number

Output Format:
The minimum size of K that guarantees the existence of 2 players who fight with each other in any K-sized subset of the class.

Sample Input:
4

Sample Output:
3

Explanation:
If the team = {1,2,3}: 1&amp;2 or 1&amp;3 can fight with each other
If the team = {1,3,4}: 1&amp;3 or 1&amp;4 can fight with each other
If the team = {2,3,4}: 2&amp;4 can fight with each other
If K=2, then the teams {3,4} or {2,3} will have no fights. So 3 is the smallest value of K for which any K-sized team, must include a fighting pair.

Sample Input:
2

Sample Output:
2

Explanation:
The team = {1,2}: 1&amp;2 can fight with each other

---Question :92---
Jack love playing games, Gluttonous snake( an old game in Nokia era) is one of his favorite. However, after playing gluttonous snake so many times, he finally got bored with the game, so he changed the rules:

Rule 1: Write a code to find the Max sum path in a grid (2-D array), with dimension with n rows and m column (1&lt;=n,m&lt;=500)

Rule 2: In the 2D Array, each cell (elements) contains a value v in the array is from (-1&lt;=v&lt;=99999)

Rule 3. You can start from any position of the leftest column (border) of the array to the rightest(border) column of the array to calculate the Max Sum path.

Rule 4. You can move up, right, down, and CAN'T move left, and can visit each element only one time.

Rule 5.If the element is -1, it means the path is blocked, and you can't go through the path (calculate it in the sum), you have to choose other path to calculate the sum. 

For example, if a 4*4 array grid
{{-1,3,2,1}
 {2,-1,2,4}
 {2,2,-1,3}
 {4,2,1,2}};
The max sum path is : (from grid[4][0])
4--&gt;up--&gt;2--&gt;left--&gt;2--&gt;down--&gt;2--&gt;left--&gt;
1--&gt;left--&gt;2--&gt;up--&gt;3--&gt;up--&gt;4--&gt;up--&gt;1

and the sum is 4+2+2+2+1+2+3+4+1 =21

The program behaves like a calculator asking the user to type in binary expressions (like 2.5 + 3.7) and printing out the results. If the user enters 'q' for the operator (e.g. 0 q 0) then this is taken as a signal to stop the program.
Add a new function to the program that multiplies its two arguments together and returns their product. Then modify the switch statement so that the operator '*' causes this new product function to be called. Test the program by using a mixture of '+' and '*' calculations.
Add operators for subtraction ('-') and division ('/') and test your program again.
We introduce some special operators. Write functions to implement each of these (adding one at a time and testing after each new operator is incorporated into your calculator).

Write a C program charcount.c that
reads in a string of no more than 255 characters from the user;
counts how many instances there are of each letter in the string; (note, for this program we ignore case so, e.g., the number of letter 'a' characters includes the total number of lower case 'a's and upper case 'A's.)
prints out the resulting count for each letter.
i.e. if the user enters "Time and Tide Wait for No Man", the program should print
 a: 3 b: 0 c: 0 d: 2 e: 2 f: 1 g: 0 h: 0 i: 3 j: 0 k: 0 l: 0 m: 2
 n: 3 o: 2 p: 0 q: 0 r: 1 s: 0 t: 3 u: 0 v: 0 w: 1 x: 0 y: 0 z: 0
Hint: This program is a bit trickier than the others so here is an outline of the processing required
declare a char array to store the string
declare an int array of size 26 to store the count for each letter e.g. count[0] is the number of a's, count[1] the number of b's etc.
read in the string and then process it element by element
if the element is not an alphabetic character i.e. A -Z or a - z, ignore it
otherwise, convert it to a number between 0 and 25 (i.e. a or A become 0, z or Z become 25) and update the corresponding count.

Board Game: 

1) Write a program that can take a board of N x N filled with alphabets and print/return all the words that can be constructed by connecting alphabets together. You're allowed to connect alphabets in any direction including diagonally, the only restriction is that you cannot cross over the same alphabet twice. So for eg:

A,B,C,D
E,K,L,A
C,A,M,N
D,I,N,G

So example words that can be made are: BEAD, CALM, CAN, DAMN, MAKE.

2) What's the run time for your algorithm? Does your algorithm scale for large sizes of the matrix? What optimizations can you make to improve the run time.

You are given an array of variable length, which contains only following integers: -1, 0, 1. 
Example A[] = {0, 1, 0, 1, 1, -1, 1}
You are also given an integer S. 

Write a program with O(n) time that can find out the length of the largest sub-array which sums up to S. 
Example, if S = 2, then the length of the largest sub-array in the above array is 6. 

If there is no such sub-array that can sum up to S, then output 0.

Given a 2D matrix of integers, sort it such that:

 - every row is sorted in ascending order from left to right
 - every column is sorted in ascending order from top to down
 - all items in the same row are unique

You may assume the input matrix is always valid, meaning that such a sort is always possible.

Question: A real estate company plans to open relief distribution in few cities of a state. 
The input in the first Line N(number of cities...2 as per example)
 and M(Number of distribution center...5 as per example).
 The next lines have the number of population in N(2) cities. (2000 and 5000) as per example. 
 Only people from a specific city can go to the distribution center of that city.

WAP to find the number of max people those can be accommodated in a distribution center.

The answer is 1000 in this case. As there are 7 distribution center. 
First City having 2000 population will have 2 distribution center and second city having 5000 population will have 5 centers.

Therefore Max person that can be accommodated in a center is 1000.
