Each line consists of three fields "Student ID," "Subject," and "Marks." "Student ID" and "Marks" are integers and "Subject" is a string that does not contain '|' or newlines. There can be any number of students and up to 6 subjects. The fields are separated by the '|' character. 

Currently, the existing program reads the input and creates an from the lines of input. Then it calls a method processData on this ArrayList, and prints the returned data to the output file. Unfortunately, processData currently does not do anything useful - it just returns an empty `Map. 

You have to modify processData to compute the marks scored in each subject by the student with the lowest ID (who has actually appeared for that test). Thus, processData will returns a Map that maps each Subject to the marks scored. In other words, the map will contain each subject name as a key, and the marks scored by the student with the lowest ID as the value for that entry. 

If your program is run with the input given above, it should produce the following output:

Need Java Program :

A rectangular plot comprising n*m block ( cement block in shape of a cube) were kept, one block per each cell. the base of 

each block covers one cell completely and its surface is equals to one square meter. cube on adjacent cell are so close 

that there are no gaps between them.due to a heavy rain on the constuction, water is accumulated in the gaps created 

between a group of blocks due to the difference in their heights.

write a program to calculate the volume of water accumulated between the blocks on the constrution.

Input Specifications:

your function must read three arguments i.e
where 
 - Plot_length (r) : provides the length of each rectangular plot in metres.
 - Plot_breadth (c) : provides the breadth of each rectangular plot in metres.
 - Block_height(int array) : provides the height of r*c blocks row-wise.

Constraints


Output Specifications:
output will be an integer that will depict the volume of water (in cubic metres) accumulated in the puddles due to the 

difference in heights of block.

Examples:
Example 1:
input1 =3
input2=6
input3={3,3,4,4,4,2,3,1,3,2,1,4,7,3,1,6,4,1}

output: 5

---Question :27---
Need Java code:
 In a Multinational company employees are ordered to seat according to their height in a line. they always choose their 

positions randomly to displeasure their manager. one evening, the employee learn that their strict manager has secretly 

recorded their seating positions from that morning, and that he will be checking their positions in the next moning to 

make sure they are exactly the same.

Each employee only remember one thing from that morning: the number of people to his left that were teller then him. 

there are N employees, each with a different height between 1 to n. using this information you must reconstruct the 

seating arrangement from that morning.

you are given a int[], the ith element of which represents the number of taller employees to the left of the employee with 

height i (where i is a 1-based index). Return a int[] containing the heights of the employees from left to right in the line.

Note: The input is guaranteed to produce a valid and unique output.

Inputs Specifications:
your function should accept the fallowing inputs:
Input 1: N
Input 2: An array(left[]) of n integers

Output Specifications:
you need to return the int [] containing the heights of the employees from left to right in the line.

Example :
Input:
input 1: 4
input 2: {2,1,1,0}

Output: {4,2,1,3}

Explanation:
Employee of height 1 remembered there were 2 employees taller than him to his left.
Employee of height 2 remembered there were 1 employees taller than him to his left.
Employee of height 3 remembered there were 1 employees taller than him to his left.
Employee of height 4 remembered there were no employees taller than him to his left.
the orginal order from left to right must have been 4,2,13.

this ordering satisfies all four conditions.
For example, there are exactly two employees to the left of the employees with height 1 that are taller then him(heights 4 

and 2). A different ordering,like 4,3,1,2, satisfies some, but not all of the four conditions. in this incorrect ordering, there 

are two employees to the left of employee with height 2 that are taller then him(height 4 and 3), but input states that 

there was only one.

There are N friends sitting in a circle, they are numbered clockwise 1 to N. Game starts with 

player 1 receiving the ball. A player needs to pass the ball to other player based on some 

conditions.
1. if he is receiving ball for pth time,he passes that ball to persion L places to left if P is even 

or L places right if P is odd.
2. if any player receives the ball M times then game is over.

Eample : 
Input 1(N):5
Input 1(M):3
Input 1(L):2

Output: 10

Explanation:
 First player 1 gets tha ball. since he has held the ball 1 time , he passes the ball to player 4, 

who is two places to his right. this is player 4 first time holding the ball, so he gives it to 

player 2, who passes it to player 5. player 5 then passes the ball to player3. who passes it 

back to player 1.since player 1 has now held the ball 2 times, hepasses it to player 3, who 

passes it to player 5, who then passes the ball to player 2. finally, player 2 passes the ball to 

player 4, who then passes it to player 1. player 1 has now held the ball 3 times, and the game

 assert(finder.distance("fox","the") == 3);
 assert(finder.distance("quick", "fox") == 1);
 
 "quick" appears twice in the input. There are two possible distance values for "quick" and "fox":

Stanford has to select a team of dodgeball players from its class of 2013. There are n students in the class and each student is identified by his/her student ID, which is between 1 and n. The coach has to select K players out of these n students for his team. But there is a twist, if among the K dodgeball players, a player's ID number evenly divides another player's ID number, then there is a high chance of them getting into a fight. The coach will do his best to select the K players so that no pair of players among them will want to fight one another. But if the game turns out to be very popular, this becomes impossible. Complete the function dodgeBall to return the minimum size of K at which it becomes impossible to choose a dodgeball team that has no fighting?

Input Format:
One line of text, containing the size of the class of 2013, n

Constraints:
n is guaranteed to be an even number

Output Format:
The minimum size of K that guarantees the existence of 2 players who fight with each other in any K-sized subset of the class.

Sample Input:
4

Sample Output:
3

Explanation:
If K=2, then the teams {3,4} or {2,3} will have no fights. So 3 is the smallest value of K for which any K-sized team, must include a fighting pair.

Jack love playing games, Gluttonous snake( an old game in Nokia era) is one of his favorite. However, after playing gluttonous snake so many times, he finally got bored with the game, so he changed the rules:

Rule 1: Write a code to find the Max sum path in a grid (2-D array), with dimension with n rows and m column 

Rule 2: In the 2D Array, each cell (elements) contains a value v in the array is from 

Rule 3. You can start from any position of the leftest column (border) of the array to the rightest(border) column of the array to calculate the Max Sum path.

Rule 4. You can move up, right, down, and CAN'T move left, and can visit each element only one time.

Rule 5.If the element is -1, it means the path is blocked, and you can't go through the path (calculate it in the sum), you have to choose other path to calculate the sum. 

For example, if a 4*4 array grid
{{-1,3,2,1}
 {2,-1,2,4}
 {2,2,-1,3}
 {4,2,1,2}};
The max sum path is : (from grid[4][0])


and the sum is 4+2+2+2+1+2+3+4+1 =21

counts how many instances there are of each letter in the string; (note, for this program we ignore case so, e.g., the number of letter 'a' characters includes the total number of lower case 'a's and upper case 'A's.)
prints out the resulting count for each letter.
i.e. if the user enters "Time and Tide Wait for No Man", the program should print
Hint: This program is a bit trickier than the others so here is an outline of the processing required
declare a char array to store the string
declare an int array of size 26 to store the count for each letter e.g. count[0] is the number of a's, count[1] the number of b's etc.
read in the string and then process it element by element
if the element is not an alphabetic character i.e. A -Z or a - z, ignore it
otherwise, convert it to a number between 0 and 25 (i.e. a or A become 0, z or Z become 25) and update the corresponding count.

He asked me to write the program on paper in any language.

This is how i approached it.
1) First i gave the brute force solution and explained it to him. He liked it.
2) Then he asked for the complexity of the solution. I gave right ans.
3) Then i told him that it can be optimized by 'xyz' approach. 
4) Then he asked me if i can write the solution. I said i will first explain him how it can be solved. Then if he wants me to write the code, he will have to leave me alone for some time. He agreed. I explained. 
5) There was a bug in my solution. He gave a test case that exposed it. Then i rectified the bug. He accepted.

 The next lines have the number of population in N(2) cities. (2000 and 5000) as per example. 
 Only people from a specific city can go to the distribution center of that city.

WAP to find the number of max people those can be accommodated in a distribution center.

The answer is 1000 in this case. As there are 7 distribution center. 
First City having 2000 population will have 2 distribution center and second city having 5000 population will have 5 centers.

Therefore Max person that can be accommodated in a center is 1000.
