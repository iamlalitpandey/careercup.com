1-800-CODING-CHALLENGE
Many companies like to list their phone numbers using the letters printed on most
telephones. This makes the number easier to remember for customers. An example may
be 1-800-FLOWERS
This coding challenge is to write a program that will show a user possible matches for a list
of provided phone numbers.
Your program should be a command line application that reads from files specified as
command-line arguments or STDIN when no files are given. Each line of these files will
contain a single phone number.
For each phone number read, your program should output all possible word replacements
from a dictionary. Your program should try to replace every digit of the provided phone
number with a letter from a dictionary word; however, if no match can be made, a single
digit can be left as is at that point. No two consecutive digits can remain unchanged and
the program should skip over a number (producing no output) if a match cannot be made.
Your program should allow the user to set a dictionary with the -d command-line option,
but it's fine to use a reasonable default for your system. The dictionary is expected to have
one word per line.
All punctuation and whitespace should be ignored in both phone numbers and the
dictionary file. The program should not be case sensitive, letting "a" == "A". Output should
be capital letters and digits separated at word boundaries with a single dash (-), one
possible word encoding per line. For example, if your program is fed the number:
! 2255.63
One possible line of output is
! CALL-ME
According to my dictionary.
The number encoding on the phone the program will use is:
DIGIT CHARACTERS
2 A B C
3 D E F
4 G H I
5 J K L
DIGIT CHARACTERS
6 M N O
7 P Q R S
8 T U V
9 W X Y Z

---Question :4---
Our merchants receive "weekly" invoices, following these rules:

- Each Saturday (00:00 UTC) marks the beginning of a new billing period
- Each 1st of a month (00:00 UTC) marks the beginning of a new billing
 period
- Within a year, billing periods are numbered consecutively, starting
 with billing period number 1 on Jan 1

Billing periods can therefore be identified by a year and a period
number.

Task:
-----
Write the following functions:

*) For a given date, return the id of the latest period that ends
 before this date, e.g.

 auto getLatestBillingPeriodId(Date date) -&gt; PeriodId;

*) For a given period id, return the begin and the end date of the
 billing period, e.g.

 auto getDateRange(PeriodId periodId) -&gt; std::pair&lt;Date, Date&gt;;

---Question :18---
Write a java program:

There is plant species (say P) in a desert that has a specific living pattern. A rectangular 

field of the land is divided into squara cell.The land will have R rows and C columns of the 

cell.Each cell will be surrounded by up-to eight neighboring cells(note that the cells at the 

edge of the field will have fewer then eight nuighboring cells). A cell can either be empty

(having no plant in it) or living(having a plant in it).A particular cell is said to have N 

neighbors(1&lt;N&lt;8), if exactly N cells in the neighborhood have living plants.

the plants fallow a certain rules for survival.the rules are as fallows.
1) if a cell with plant s1 to s2 neighbors (1&lt;=s1&lt;=s2&lt;=8), it survives to the next generation. 

i.e. the plant dies if it has less than s1 neighbors or more than s2 neighbors.
2) If an empty cell has B1 to B2 neidhbors (1&lt;=B1&lt;=B2&lt;=8), a new plant takes birth in that cell 

in the next generation.

Input Specification:
theinput will have two arrays, as fallows

1)An integer array: {R,C,S1,S2,B1,B2,G}
where R and C specify size of the field in row and columns respectively, with 1&lt;=R&lt;=2000 and 

1&lt;=C&lt;=2000 s1,s2,B1 and B2 are integers as explained in the survival rules. G is the number of 

generations for wich the simulation has to be run.

2)An integer array specifying intial state of the field: size of the array will be R*c
the data will be expressed in the array as fallows:{E11,E12,E1c,E21,....,E2C,ER1,ERC} where Eij 

is cell in the field at ith row and jth column. Eij can have value 0 or 1. 0 corresponds to 

empty cell and 1 corresponds to living cell.

output specification:
output will be an integer array specifying state of the field at the end of the simulation in 

the same manner as in input.

Examples:

Example 1:
input1: {3,4,2,3,3,3,3}
input2: {0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0}
output : {0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0}

Example 2:
input1: {3,4,2,3,3,3,4}
input2: {0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0}
output: {0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0}

---Question :19---
you are given an MxN matric.Every cell of the matrix has a cost associated. initially you are at(0,0) and you have to reach (M-1,N-1). Question is to find the minimum cost path from (0,0) to (M-1,N-1) and also the minimum cost. From a cell you can only make a move to right cell or down cell or diagonally lower cell.

Input Specification:
Input1: A string array containing rows of the cost matrix as element.
input2: An integer having number of rows in the cost matrix.

For above example, the matrix would be {5#7#2#4,1#8#1#3,6#2#9#5,1#6#2#8} and number of rows would be 4.

output Specification:
The output will be a string containing minimum cost and the path chosen separated by the comma.

For Example , Given the cost matrix

	5 7 2 4
	1 8 1 3 
	6 2 9 5
	1 6 2 8

1) minimum cost value is 5+1+2+2+8=18
2) minimum cost path from (0,0,) to (M-1,N-1) is BDDR

B- for down move
D- Diagonal Move
R- Right move
NA- No solution

Hence your output will be 18,BDDR

method signature:

Print the maximum number of coins that you can collect.

Clarification: you can do as many moves as you wish, the point is to collect maximum number of coins. If you are located at position (a, b) you may jump to position (a+dx, b+dy) for all dx &gt; 0 and dy &gt; 0

@krbchd: Your algorithm may output incorrect values. Suppose there are points (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9) for y coordinates LIS will output 7, 8, 9, however since these points are on the same x axis, you can choose only one of them.

Each line consists of three fields "Student ID," "Subject," and "Marks." "Student ID" and "Marks" are integers and "Subject" is a string that does not contain '|' or newlines. There can be any number of students and up to 6 subjects. The fields are separated by the '|' character. 

Currently, the existing program reads the input and creates an ArrayList&lt;String&gt; from the lines of input. Then it calls a method processData on this ArrayList, and prints the returned data to the output file. Unfortunately, processData currently does not do anything useful - it just returns an empty `Map. 

You have to modify processData to compute the marks scored in each subject by the student with the lowest ID (who has actually appeared for that test). Thus, processData will returns a Map that maps each Subject to the marks scored. In other words, the map will contain each subject name as a key, and the marks scored by the student with the lowest ID as the value for that entry. 

If your program is run with the input given above, it should produce the following output:

Need Java code:
 In a Multinational company employees are ordered to seat according to their height in a line. they always choose their 

positions randomly to displeasure their manager. one evening, the employee learn that their strict manager has secretly 

recorded their seating positions from that morning, and that he will be checking their positions in the next moning to 

make sure they are exactly the same.

Each employee only remember one thing from that morning: the number of people to his left that were teller then him. 

there are N employees, each with a different height between 1 to n. using this information you must reconstruct the 

seating arrangement from that morning.

you are given a int[], the ith element of which represents the number of taller employees to the left of the employee with 

height i (where i is a 1-based index). Return a int[] containing the heights of the employees from left to right in the line.

Note: The input is guaranteed to produce a valid and unique output.

Inputs Specifications:
your function should accept the fallowing inputs:
Input 1: N
Input 2: An array(left[]) of n integers

Output Specifications:
you need to return the int [] containing the heights of the employees from left to right in the line.

Example :
Input:
input 1: 4
input 2: {2,1,1,0}

Output: {4,2,1,3}

Explanation:
Employee of height 1 remembered there were 2 employees taller than him to his left.
Employee of height 2 remembered there were 1 employees taller than him to his left.
Employee of height 3 remembered there were 1 employees taller than him to his left.
Employee of height 4 remembered there were no employees taller than him to his left.
the orginal order from left to right must have been 4,2,13.

this ordering satisfies all four conditions.
For example, there are exactly two employees to the left of the employees with height 1 that are taller then him(heights 4 

and 2). A different ordering,like 4,3,1,2, satisfies some, but not all of the four conditions. in this incorrect ordering, there 

are two employees to the left of employee with height 2 that are taller then him(height 4 and 3), but input states that 

there was only one.

---Question :61---
This class will be given a list of words (such as might be tokenized
 from a paragraph of text), and will provide a method that takes two
 words and returns the shortest distance (in words) between those two
 words in the provided text.
 Example:
 WordDistanceFinder finder = new WordDistanceFinder(Arrays.asList("the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "quick"));
 assert(finder.distance("fox","the") == 3);
 assert(finder.distance("quick", "fox") == 1);
 
 "quick" appears twice in the input. There are two possible distance values for "quick" and "fox":
 (3 - 1) = 2 and (4 - 3) = 1.
 Since we have to return the shortest distance between the two words we return 1.

---Question :62---
Stanford has to select a team of dodgeball players from its class of 2013. There are n students in the class and each student is identified by his/her student ID, which is between 1 and n. The coach has to select K players out of these n students for his team. But there is a twist, if among the K dodgeball players, a player's ID number evenly divides another player's ID number, then there is a high chance of them getting into a fight. The coach will do his best to select the K players so that no pair of players among them will want to fight one another. But if the game turns out to be very popular, this becomes impossible. Complete the function dodgeBall to return the minimum size of K at which it becomes impossible to choose a dodgeball team that has no fighting?

Input Format:
One line of text, containing the size of the class of 2013, n

Constraints:
1 &lt;= n &lt;= 5,000,000,000
n is guaranteed to be an even number

Output Format:
The minimum size of K that guarantees the existence of 2 players who fight with each other in any K-sized subset of the class.

Sample Input:
4

Sample Output:
3

Explanation:
If the team = {1,2,3}: 1&amp;2 or 1&amp;3 can fight with each other
If the team = {1,3,4}: 1&amp;3 or 1&amp;4 can fight with each other
If the team = {2,3,4}: 2&amp;4 can fight with each other
If K=2, then the teams {3,4} or {2,3} will have no fights. So 3 is the smallest value of K for which any K-sized team, must include a fighting pair.

Sample Input:
2

Sample Output:
2

Explanation:
The team = {1,2}: 1&amp;2 can fight with each other

---Question :92---
Jack love playing games, Gluttonous snake( an old game in Nokia era) is one of his favorite. However, after playing gluttonous snake so many times, he finally got bored with the game, so he changed the rules:

Rule 1: Write a code to find the Max sum path in a grid (2-D array), with dimension with n rows and m column (1&lt;=n,m&lt;=500)

Rule 2: In the 2D Array, each cell (elements) contains a value v in the array is from (-1&lt;=v&lt;=99999)

Rule 3. You can start from any position of the leftest column (border) of the array to the rightest(border) column of the array to calculate the Max Sum path.

Rule 4. You can move up, right, down, and CAN'T move left, and can visit each element only one time.

Rule 5.If the element is -1, it means the path is blocked, and you can't go through the path (calculate it in the sum), you have to choose other path to calculate the sum. 

For example, if a 4*4 array grid
{{-1,3,2,1}
 {2,-1,2,4}
 {2,2,-1,3}
 {4,2,1,2}};
The max sum path is : (from grid[4][0])
4--&gt;up--&gt;2--&gt;left--&gt;2--&gt;down--&gt;2--&gt;left--&gt;
1--&gt;left--&gt;2--&gt;up--&gt;3--&gt;up--&gt;4--&gt;up--&gt;1

and the sum is 4+2+2+2+1+2+3+4+1 =21

The program behaves like a calculator asking the user to type in binary expressions (like 2.5 + 3.7) and printing out the results. If the user enters 'q' for the operator (e.g. 0 q 0) then this is taken as a signal to stop the program.
Add a new function to the program that multiplies its two arguments together and returns their product. Then modify the switch statement so that the operator '*' causes this new product function to be called. Test the program by using a mixture of '+' and '*' calculations.
Add operators for subtraction ('-') and division ('/') and test your program again.
We introduce some special operators. Write functions to implement each of these (adding one at a time and testing after each new operator is incorporated into your calculator).

Write a C program charcount.c that
reads in a string of no more than 255 characters from the user;
counts how many instances there are of each letter in the string; (note, for this program we ignore case so, e.g., the number of letter 'a' characters includes the total number of lower case 'a's and upper case 'A's.)
prints out the resulting count for each letter.
i.e. if the user enters "Time and Tide Wait for No Man", the program should print
 a: 3 b: 0 c: 0 d: 2 e: 2 f: 1 g: 0 h: 0 i: 3 j: 0 k: 0 l: 0 m: 2
 n: 3 o: 2 p: 0 q: 0 r: 1 s: 0 t: 3 u: 0 v: 0 w: 1 x: 0 y: 0 z: 0
Hint: This program is a bit trickier than the others so here is an outline of the processing required
declare a char array to store the string
declare an int array of size 26 to store the count for each letter e.g. count[0] is the number of a's, count[1] the number of b's etc.
read in the string and then process it element by element
if the element is not an alphabetic character i.e. A -Z or a - z, ignore it
otherwise, convert it to a number between 0 and 25 (i.e. a or A become 0, z or Z become 25) and update the corresponding count.

Board Game: 

1) Write a program that can take a board of N x N filled with alphabets and print/return all the words that can be constructed by connecting alphabets together. You're allowed to connect alphabets in any direction including diagonally, the only restriction is that you cannot cross over the same alphabet twice. So for eg:

A,B,C,D
E,K,L,A
C,A,M,N
D,I,N,G

So example words that can be made are: BEAD, CALM, CAN, DAMN, MAKE.

2) What's the run time for your algorithm? Does your algorithm scale for large sizes of the matrix? What optimizations can you make to improve the run time.

 The next lines have the number of population in N(2) cities. (2000 and 5000) as per example. 
 Only people from a specific city can go to the distribution center of that city.

WAP to find the number of max people those can be accommodated in a distribution center.

The answer is 1000 in this case. As there are 7 distribution center. 
First City having 2000 population will have 2 distribution center and second city having 5000 population will have 5 centers.

Therefore Max person that can be accommodated in a center is 1000.

Organization has online services running across world. To use online services, User create account by entering personal details like - First Name, Last Name, Phone number, Address and etc... 
Russia has passed new law that any Russian citizen who is creating account to use online services, his account information needs to store in Russia first and then read-only copies allowed to replicate across the world.
Please suggest cost effective solution/design for this scenario otherwise online services will be blocked to use in Russia. How do we handle if any other country Germany is also come up with this law?

Issues:
1. Do not have mechanism to identify citizenship of user. 
2. If Russia user creates an account, he/she should not wait to use online services.

We have right angle triangle with same height, base and area of four types. 
Types can be distinguish using points 
i.e {1,0,1,1}, {1,1,0,1} etc which makes a right angle triangle in one block. We have to identify total count each triangle type. There are multiple cases 
1. Include every possible triangle shape one can overlap with other triangle cell 
2. Include every possible triangle shape without overlap with other triangle cell 
3. Include adjacent triangles only (exclude triangle which is adjacent to two triangles ) 
4.Include adjacent triangles only 
i.e : Input pattern

---Question :303---
Given an array of five integers that represents a poker hand e.g. [2,2,2,3,3] return the value of the hand, valid values are only "pair","two pairs","three of a kind","full house","four of a kind" we don't have to worry about straight, flush or straight flush.

My approach was to have a fixed array of 13 elements (each element represents one possible value of the hand) this array will keep the occurrence of each value of our hand and after we have all the values we just iterate this array and multiply all the values by itself and adding them to get a unique result.

For example if we have [2,2,3,4,5] our fixed array will have a "2" and three "1" so our result will be "2*2+1*1+1*1+1*1",the result will be 7, so all the possible hands will have unique values, if we find a 7 as a result we will know it is a pair, a 9 will be two pairs, a 11 will be three of a kind, 13 will be a full house and 17 will be a four of a kind.

This algorithm is O(1) both in complexity and space but the interviewer didn't like it too much.

Write a function that will operate on a C-string and convert all instances of "AB" to "C" without using a second string for temporary storage. Use the following function signature: 

 void translate(char *str) 

 So for example: 

 char astring[] = "helloABworld"; 

 translate(astring); 

 // Now astring holds "helloCworld"; 

 Your function should handle strings of arbitrary length.

Assume that garbage collector is not there in place or you are implementing a garbage collector for C++. Write the design and sample code for garbage collector implementation 
We have 3 classed and Class A, B, C. object of A uses object B and Object of B uses Object of C. How can we track the object existence and clear memory ?
Answer which I suggested : Write a tree (or Graph?)data structure (Garbage collector is a container class holds this data structure) where each node has multiple paths to reach. If any of the node is not having a path to reach then we can clean that memory. This way the garbage collection will work. Please suggest your design as well.

Given an array of words (i.e. ["ABCW", "BAZ", "FOO", "BAR", "XTFN", "ABCDEF"]), find the max value of length(s) * length(t), where s and t are words from the array. The catch here is that the two words cannot share any characters.

Assume that there are many words in the array (N words) and average length of word is M.

Answer for the example above is "ABCW" and "XTFN" as the result is 4 * 4 = 12. 

"ABCW" and "ABCDEF" do not work since they share similar characters.

---Question :321---
We have a long string. We label some substrings with tags. 

- A tag entry is [startIndex, endIndex, tag].
- Query: 1 or more tags
- Output: all blocks/ranges with all queried tags.

Example tag entries:

 [23, 72, 0]	// label [23, 72) with tag 0
 [34, 53, 1]	// label [34, 53) with tag 1
 [100, 128, 0]

Query and Output:

 0 =&gt; [23, 72], [100, 128]
 0,1 =&gt; [34,53]	// [34, 53) matches both tag 0 and 1

Give an efficient algorithm. Please describe your algorithm before posting code.

**Edit**: To add some difficulties, partial overlap is treated the same as full overlap, ONLY the overlapped part matches both tags. E.g. if we have entries:

 [23, 72, 0]	// label [23, 72) with tag 0
 [10, 53, 1]	// label [34, 53) with tag 1

Query and Output:
 0,1 =&gt; [23,53]	// [23, 53) matches both tag 0 and 1

Minor detials: Note in the comments we used open range on the right, i.e. if the string named "str", [23, 72, 0] includes str[23] but NOT str[72]; and there's no overlap between the following entries:
[23, 72, 0]
[10, 23, 0]

Easier to implement with just the indices and we can say 4 times faster. Another solution I gave was to use multithreading. He said no multithreading.

design question:
I will request you to first read only upto Solution-2 only and try to think about your solution and then read other lines. If we read whole post(without thinking about your solution) then your brain will get polluted with my idea and you may not be able to think naturally.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
One machine daily taking backup of its datatstore on some server machine, MINIMIZE network data transferred.

Solution -1 : Compress storage and then send over network

Solution - 2 : Take diff and send only diff(and not whole data daily)

Interviewer asked for better ideas as above two are well known ideas but I was stuck.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So he gave me hint(no 1) and depending upon hint I devise following solution

Solution - 3: Divide storage into sequence of 1K bits so total number of possible patters are 2^1000. Now Using hashTable just store existing 1000bits-length pattern and all their sequence numbers. And, then transfer this hashTable to server. So for example datastore consists of "file1, file2, file3=file1+file2" then we can reduce network data by 50%

So interviewer asked why 1000bits and why not 100bits or 10000bits. Also, as we increase length of bit-pattern, probability of getting duplicate patterns reduces and if we decrease length of pattern we may not be able to effectively reduce network data transferred

Solution-4: Don't divided storage bits into equal length pattern but in variable length pattern so client tells server "Pattern-X(bit string) of length L exists at offsets 5, 10003, 363738, 42311, 43433.

Interviewer said how can check for variable length patterns on client machine as this will be computaionally inefficient. I suggested Trie, Huffman coding, file-by-file comparison but he straightway discarded those ideas :)

He gave final important hint that 
	somehow client should give indication to server that next bytes are going to be like this without tranferring those bytes and 
	then server should tell client that "OK don't send next 1000bits as I already have them from previously send/stored data at different section(like different file) in storage"
	and asked me how to do it and how will be the handshake/protocol between server-client

Since, throughout interview I was stuck to my hashTable solution and not able to think beyond hashTable, as per HR I got negative feedback in this interview :(

Overall interviewer was helping lot and was really helpful. He gave lot of hints and time(never said "Ok thats enough let us move on"...Finally I myself gave up :) )

---Question :392---
Two political parties are contesting in the elections in the N number of states in the country. Each party wins some seats every year in each state. After the current elections are over we have the result of both the parties with their number of seats won in each state. 
The two parties are considered equal if they win the same number of seats in the N states in any order. Otherwise, they are considered unequal. Input/Output Specifications 

INPUT: 1) It is an array of N integers depicting number of seats won by party one in each state. 2) It is an array of N integers depicting number of seats won by party two in each state. 3) An integer containing number of states (N). 

OUTPUT: Equal/Unequal/Invalid 
Equal: if political parties are equal Unequal: if political parties are unequal Invalid: if any party has invalid number of seats in any state 

Examples 

Example 1: 
Two parties contested in seven states Seats won by party one in all the seven states: {12,11,5,2,7,5,-11} Seats won by party two in all the seven states: {5,12,5,7,11,2,11} The party two has an invalid number of winning seats(-11). So the output will be "Invalid". 

Input : 
1) {12,11,5,2,7,5,-11} 
2) {5,12,5,7,11,2,11} 
3) 7 

Output: Invalid 


Example 2: 
Two parties contested in seven states Seats won by party one in all the seven states: {12,11,5,2,7,5,11} Seats won by party two in all the seven states: {5,12,5,7,11,2,11} Both the parties are equal because they have got 11(2 times each), 5(2 times each),7( 1 time each), 2(1 time each), 12( 1 time each other outputs (0 times each). 

Input : 
1) {12,11,5,2,7,5,11} 
2) {5,12,5,7,11,2,11} 
3) 7 

Output: Equal 

Example 3: 

Input : 
{12,11,5,2,7,5,11} 
{5,0,5,7,11,2,11} 
 7 

Output: Unequal

---Question :402---
Rahul is playing a very interesting game. He has some N different type of match boxes. All match boxes may have different number of matchsticks (S1, S2, S3... Sn). 

Rahul chooses two random numbers F and K. K should be less than N. The game is that Rahul wants to select any K match boxes out of N match boxes such that total number of matchsticks in these K selected match boxes should be multiple of F. 
At the sametime Rahul wants that sum matchsticks of all the selected match boxes should be minimum possible. 

Input Specifications: 
1) Array S = {S1,S2,S3,...Sn} of size N corresponding to the number of match sticks in N matchboxes(0&lt;=N&lt;=1000} 
2) F-Value (as explained above) 
3) K-Value ( as explained above) 

Output: 
1 2 3 4 5 Here 3 is the number of matchsticks in matchbox I II III IV V minimum possible total number of matchsticks such that the conditioned explained in the problem statement is satisfied. Output -1 if it is not possible or invalid input. 

For example, there are 5 match boxes i.e., N = 5 
Let's say K is 3 (Rahul has to choose any 3 matchboxes) 

Let's say F is 5(sum of matchsticks in 3 selected matchboxes should be multiple of 5). 
Rahul can choose II, III and V matchboxes which would give the total sum of 10 which is multiple of F i.e., 5. And 10 is the minimum possible matchsticks possible in the above case. 
So you have to answer the minimum possible matchstick(sum of the matchsticks in the selcted matchboxes) but the conditions given above should be satisfied.

You are given two arrays of length M and N having elements in range 0-9.Your task is to create maximum number of length K from elements of these two arrays such that relative order of elements is same in the final number as in the array, they are taken from i.e. If two elements a,b are taken from array1 and and a comes before b in array1 so in the final number a should come before b (Relative order kept same) .
Example: N=4 and M =6
 Array1 = { 3 , 4 , 6,5}
 Array2 ={9,1,2,5,8,3}
Suppose K = 5, then number will be {9,8,6,5,3} 
You can see {9,8,3} are taken from array2 in the same order as they are in Array2. Similarly {6,5} are taken from Array1 in the same order and number 98653 is maximum possible number.

The first row contains two numbers:

The number of stalls
How many tickets are sold
The second line contains a list of how many tickets each stall has initially, so in this case stall 1 has 1 ticket, stall 5 has 5 tickets.

The problem: what is the maximum amount of money you can make selling the given number of tickets?

Suppose we have two CPUs, each has an L1 cache associated with it. An L2 cache is shared by the two CPUs, and it requests data from DRAM:

|CPU0| |CPU1|
|L1Cache0| |L1Cache1|
 |Shared L2C|
 |DRAM|

Let's say CPU0 and CPU1 send out a write signal at the same time:

- At timestamp 0, CPU0 sends a wr request - write address A to 0;
- Also at timestamp 0, CPU1 sends a wr request - write address A to 1;
- At timestamp 0, all of the L1/L2 caches are empty, i.e. write req will result in a miss in the cache;
- At timestamp 0, data in address A in DRAM is 100;
- Cache coherency protocol is MOESI.

What will the values be after these two writes complete? In L1, L2 and DRAM? and what are the states in each cache?

Your program will first read an integer N from stdin.
Then it will then read N lines of N integers separated by spaces.
Each integer in this Grid will be either 1 or 0.

The program then outputs an N x N Grid where each Grid element represents the number of 1's surrounding that element, (excluding the element itself).

For (column, row) = (0, 0), surrounding element indices are (0,1) (1,0) and (1,1). 
Similarly for (1,1), surrounding element indices are (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,0) (1,2) (2,0) (2,1) and (2,2). 

Constraints:

Your output lines should not have any trailing or leading white space

there are N cities (numbered from 1 to N) in the game and connect them by N-1 highways. It is guaranteed that each pair of cities are connected by the highways directly or indirectly.The game has a very important value called Total Highway Distance (THD) which is the total distances of all pairs of cities. Suppose there are 3 cities and 2 highways. The highway between City 1 and City 2 is 200 miles and the highway between City 2 and City 3 is 300 miles. So the THD is 1000(200 + 500 + 300) miles because the distances between City 1 and City 2, City 1 and City 3, City 2 and City 3 are 200 miles, 500 miles and 300 miles respectively.

During the game the length of some highways may change. you want to know the latest THD.

You are given a permutation arr[N]. E.g. arr[3] = {2, 1, 0} or arr[5] = {0,1,2,4,3};
Then you can prepare somehow and then start serving requests: request(a, b, k) = sorted(arr[a:b])[k], that is, k-th order statistic on slice [a:b] of arr.
E.g. if arr is [3,4,5,0,1,2] and a = 2 and b = 5, then arr[a:b] = [5,0,1] and let k = 2, so we sort it - get [0,1,5] and take k-th element, that is - 5.

Implement request(a, b, k) function. You can preprocess input data, that is, assume there will be only one array and many request() calls.

Can you predict the missing
grade?
Problem Statement
Introduction
The CBSE Class 12 examination, is taken by Indian high school students
at the end of K-12 school education. The scores or grades in this
examination form the basis of their entry to the College or University
system, for an undergraduate program. At the K-12 level, students
appear for examination in five subjects. These five subjects generally
include one language; three elective subjects oriented towards Science,
Commerce or Humanities; and any elective of their choice as a fifth
subject.
The Challenge
This challenge is based on real school data of the CBSE Class 12
examination conducted in the year 2013. You are given the grades
obtained by students with specific but popular combinations of subjects
(and all these students had opted for Mathematics). Their grades in four
subjects are known to you. However their grade in Mathematics (i.e, the
fifth subject) is hidden.
The records provided to you are the grades obtained by students who
had opted for the following combinations of subjects or courses and
obtained a passing grade in each subject. The individual subjects in the
data are:
English, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Computer Science, Biology,
Physical Education, Economics, Accountancy and Business Studies.
The most dominant subject combinations, account for approximately
99% of the data are:
English, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physical Education
English, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Economics
English, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Biology
English, Economics, Accountancy, Mathematics, Business Studie
s
The grades of students in four subjects (other than Mathematics) are
provided to you. Can you predict what grade they had obtained in
Mathematics?
To help you build a prediction engine, we will provide you with a training
file, containing the grade points obtained by students with the above
subject combinations, in all five subjects.
Notes about the Grading System
The student is first assessed on a scale of 100. (S)He needs a score of at
least 33% to pass in the subject. Among those who pass:
Grade 1 is assigned to the top one-eighth of students who pas
s the course.
Grade 2 is assigned to the next one-eighth of students who pa
ss the course.
.....
Grade 8 is assigned to the last one-eighth of students who pa
ss the course.
If more than 1 student share the same score and lie in the margin, they
share the higher grade.
Input Format
The first line will be an integer N. N lines follow each line being a valid
JSON object. The following fields of raw data are given in json.
SerialNumber (Numeric): The identifier of the student record.
This is provided just for identification purposes and does n
ot have any direct use.
English (numeric) : The grade (between 1 and 8) obtained in E
nglish. This will always be present.
Three more numeric fields from among: Physics, Chemistry, Com
puterScience, Hindi, Biology, PhysicalEducation, Economics, A

2
3

5
The input for each record has the grade for all subjects opted by a
student, other than Mathematics which you have to predict as the
answer.
Constraints
1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10
The SerialNumber field will contain a unique numeric identifier such
that 1 &lt;= SerialNumber &lt;= 5 * 10 .
All other fields in the JSON fragment will represent the grades obtained
in four subjects and will be populated by numeric values between 1 and
8, both inclusive.
Output Format
For each student record that is given as a JSON object, containing the
grade obtained in four subjects, output the predicted grade in
Mathematics (this will be a numeral between 1 and 8, both inclusive) in
a newline.
Training File and Sample Tests
The training file with sample test data is available here.
The three files in this package are:
training.json
sample-test.in.json
sample-test.out.json
Training data as well as sample testcases have been provided in the
above file for offline training and to help you build your prediction
model. Feel free to include file data inside your code.

Explanation
It is predicted that first candidate obtained grade 1 in Mathematics, the
second candidate achieved grade 3 in Mathematics, the third candidate
achieved grade 4 in Mathematics and so on.
Scoring
For each of the N records in the input file, we will compute:
p = abs(Predicted Grade Point in Mathematics - Actual Grade Point in
Mathematics)
Where 'abs' indicates the Absolute Value or Magnitude. If p = 0 or 1 your
answer for that particular student record will be considered correct. i.e,
we allow a tolerance of one grade point away from the correct answer,
to take into consideration the marginal errors which might occur during
the testing or grading process.
Score = 100 * ((C-W)/N)
Where C = Number of Correct predictions, not more than one grade
point away from the actual grade point assigned.
W = Number of wrong (incorrect) predictions and
N = Total number of records in the input.
While the contest is in progress, only the score based on the sample
test case will be displayed to you. After the contest is completed, we
will revise the scores based on performance on a hidden test set only.
However, when you make submissions, you will be able to see whether
your program attains a positive score on both the sample and the
hidden test cases (to avoid a situation where unexpected errors occur
on the hidden test set at the end).

3) "[&lt;&lt;((shfs8))&gt;&gt;]" is valid

Extension to the question - 
Suppose you had a hash table that told you how a parenthesis starts and how it ends as a key value pair, how would you then validate the string.
ex - &lt;key,value&gt; = &lt; '(' , ')' &gt; indicates '(' is a start parenthesis and ')' should be the end of that paranthesis.
&lt;'A','&amp;'&gt; indicates that 'A' is a start parenthesis and '&amp;' is the end parenthesis.

There is a garden of strawberry plants represented by a 2D, square array.Each plant represents an element in the matrix ie it has a number of strawberries. If a plant doesnt have strawberries it is denoted by 0. If 0 is encountered you cannot travel through that path.

 

You can start from any cell along the left border of this ground (i.e the matrix) and travel until it finally stops at one cell in the right border, and you can only move to up/down/right. You can only visit each cell once. Calculate the maximum number of berries is obtained.

Backtracking using Dynamic programming is one of the methods i have thought of.

Also there some special conditions:

a.Even in the left border and right border, we can go up and down.

b. When we are at the top cell of one column, we can still go up, which demands us to

 pay all current strawberries , then we will be teleported to the bottom cell of this column and vice

 versa.

Input: user enters dimensions of ground ie size of matrix and the matrix itself

Output: is the maximum number of strawberries collected without encountering 0; in case we do we display 0.

Till now i have managed to find the largest value in the first column of the matrix but i am facing difficulty in testing the neighbours of that cell.

Also i am not able to store the position of the cell which i started from or even mark it.

Quirks are about requirements:

Time complexity O(n) - BUT there should be some fixed constant C independent of size of input such that every element of array is written/read &lt; C times, so radix sorting the array is a no go.

Space complexity O(1) - you may modify the initial array, BUT sorted(initial_array) must equal sorted(array_after_executing_program) AND you can't store integers outside range [0, 2n) in this array (imagine that it's an array of uint32_t).

Write a program to process the matrix. If an element is 0 at ith row and jth column, then make the whole ith row and jth column to 0.

Constraints:
Space complexity should be O(1)
Time complexity - Only single pass is allowed. Note that single pass is not O(n). This is single pass : An element will read and written only ones.

Edit:

Recursion is not allowed since it is O(n) space on stack

Problem:
8 balls, where 7 have equal weight, one does not. Find minimum times to use a scale to find ball that is not equal weight.

Interviewer answer: weight 6 balls. Choose balls from lighter side. Total two attempts. This is the average case but not the best case.

This is not true in all cases and the interviewer did not see this...

Best case:
Pick two balls. One may weight less, so the lighter ball is found with one attempt. This is the best case.

Worst case: If first two balls are equal, weight 6 balls. Choose balls from lighter side. Weight again. Total three attempts.

---Question :591---
You are given a board with N rows and M columns. In this board you have to place exactly 1 bishop in each row. There are also some obstacles in some of the cells where you can't place a bishop. Bishops can only move diagonally but they can't go to a cell where there is any obstacle. Two bishops can attack each other if one of them can move to the cell of the other bishop. Now you have to count the number of ways that you can place bishops in the board.

Note: Two bishops can attack each other if one of them can move to the cell of the other bishop in a single move without passing any obstacles.

Input Format

The first line of the input contains two integers N and M. The following N lines contain M characters each, the description of the board. Each cell of the board is either '.' which means that this cell is free or '*' which means that this cell contains an obstacle.

Constraints

1&lt;=N,M&lt;=10
Output Format

Print only one integer representing the number of ways to put exactly one bishop in each row such that no two bishops attack each other.

Sample Input

Given a string which only contains lowercase. You need delete the repeated letters only leave one, and try to make the lexicographical order of new string is smallest.
i.e:
bcabc
You need delete 1 'b' and 1 'c', so you delete the first 'b' and first 'c', the new string will be abc which is smallest.

ps: If you try to use greedy algorithm to solve this problem, you must sure that you could pass this case:
cbacdcbc. answer is acdb not adcb

I can't solve this problem well and the interviewer said that you can scan the string twice. First scan is do some preprocess, and the second is to get the answer, but I really can't come up this idea.

Given N tasks, find the maximal points that can be achieved by finishing them

Problem Constraints

There are T minutes for completing N tasks

Solutions can be submitted at any time, including exactly T minutes after the start

i-th task submitted t minutes after the start, will get maxPoints[i] - t * pointsPerMinute[i] points

i-th task takes requiredTime[i] minutes to solve

Input Format

Line 1: T, total minutes available to finish

Line 2: Comma separated list of maxPoints

Line 3: Comma separated list of pointsPerMinute

Line 4: Comma separated list of requiredTime

Sample Input

75

250,500,1000

2,4,8

25,25,25

Sample Output

1200

Explanation

First, solve the third task 25 minutes after the start of the contest. Get 1000 - 8 * 25 = 800 points

Second, solve the second task 50 minutes after the start of the contest. Get 500 - 4 * 50 = 300 points

Third, solve the first task 75 minutes after the start of the contest. Get 250 - 2 * 75 = 100 points

In total, get 800 + 300 + 100 = 1200 points


Any optimized solution for this ?
