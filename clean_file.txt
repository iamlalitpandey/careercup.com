most telephones this makes the number easier to remember for customers an example may be flowers this coding challenge is to write a program that will show a user possible matches for a list of provided phone numbers your program should be a command line application that reads from files specified as command line arguments or stdin when no files are given each line of these files will contain a single phone number for each phone number read your program should output all possible word replacements from a dictionary your program should try to replace every digit of the provided phone number with a letter from a dictionary word however if no match can be made a single digit can be left as is at that point no two consecutive digits can remain unchanged and the program should skip over a number producing no output if a match cannot be made your program should allow the user to set a dictionary with the d command line option but it s fine to use a reasonable default for your system the dictionary is expected to have one word per line all punctuation and whitespace should be ignored in both phone numbers and the dictionary file the program should not be case sensitive letting a a output should be capital letters and digits separated at word boundaries with a single dash one possible word encoding per line for example if your program is fed the number one possible line of output is call me according to my dictionary the number encoding on the phone the program will use is digit characters a b c d e f g h i j k l digit characters m n o p q r s t u v w x y z.our
