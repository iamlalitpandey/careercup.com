most telephones this makes the number easier to remember for customers an example may be flowers this coding challenge is to write a program that will show a user possible matches for a list of provided phone numbers your program should be a command line application that reads from files specified as command line arguments or stdin when no files are given each line of these files will contain a single phone number for each phone number read your program should output all possible word replacements from a dictionary your program should try to replace every digit of the provided phone number with a letter from a dictionary word however if no match can be made a single digit can be left as is at that point no two consecutive digits can remain unchanged and the program should skip over a number producing no output if a match cannot be made your program should allow the user to set a dictionary with the d command line option but it s fine to use a reasonable default for your system the dictionary is expected to have one word per line all punctuation and whitespace should be ignored in both phone numbers and the dictionary file the program should not be case sensitive letting a a output should be capital letters and digits separated at word boundaries with a single dash one possible word encoding per line for example if your program is fed the number one possible line of output is call me according to my dictionary the number encoding on the phone the program will use is digit characters a b c d e f g h i j k l digit characters m n o p q r s t u v w x y z.our

its datatstore on some server machine minimize network data transferred solution compress storage and then send over network solution take diff and send only diff and not whole data daily interviewer asked for better ideas as above two are well known ideas but i was stuck so he gave me hint no and depending upon hint i devise following solution solution divide storage into sequence of k bits so total number of possible patters are now using hashtable just store existing bits length pattern and all their sequence numbers and then transfer this hashtable to server so for example datastore consists of file file file file file then we can reduce network data by so interviewer asked why bits and why not bits or bits also as we increase length of bit pattern probability of getting duplicate patterns reduces and if we decrease length of pattern we may not be able to effectively reduce network data transferred solution don t divided storage bits into equal length pattern but in variable length pattern so client tells server pattern x bit string of length l exists at offsets interviewer said how can check for variable length patterns on client machine as this will be computaionally inefficient i suggested trie huffman coding file by file comparison but he straightway discarded those ideas he gave final important hint that somehow client should give indication to server that next bytes are going to be like this without tranferring those bytes and then server should tell client that ok don t send next bits as i already have them from previously send stored data at different section like different file in storage and asked me how to do it and how will be the handshake protocol between server client since throughout interview i was stuck to my hashtable solution and not able to think beyond hashtable as per hr i got negative feedback in this interview overall interviewer was helping lot and was really helpful he gave lot of hints and time never said

school education the scores or grades in this examination form the basis of their entry to the college or university system for an undergraduate program at the k level students appear for examination in five subjects these five subjects generally include one language three elective subjects oriented towards science commerce or humanities and any elective of their choice as a fifth subject the challenge this challenge is based on real school data of the cbse class examination conducted in the year you are given the grades obtained by students with specific but popular combinations of subjects and all these students had opted for mathematics their grades in four subjects are known to you however their grade in mathematics i e the fifth subject is hidden the records provided to you are the grades obtained by students who had opted for the following combinations of subjects or courses and obtained a passing grade in each subject the individual subjects in the data are english physics chemistry mathematics computer science biology physical education economics accountancy and business studies the most dominant subject combinations account for approximately of the data are english physics chemistry mathematics physical education english physics chemistry mathematics economics english physics chemistry mathematics biology english economics accountancy mathematics business studie s the grades of students in four subjects other than mathematics are provided to you can you predict what grade they had obtained in mathematics to help you build a prediction engine we will provide you with a training file containing the grade points obtained by students with the above subject combinations in all five subjects notes about the grading system the student is first assessed on a scale of s he needs a score of at least to pass in the subject among those who pass grade is assigned to the top one eighth of students who pas s the course grade is assigned to the next one eighth of students who pa ss the course grade is assigned to the last one eighth of students who pa ss the course if more than student share the same score and lie in the margin they share the higher grade input format the first line will be an integer n n lines follow each line being a valid json object the following fields of raw data are given in json serialnumber numeric the identifier of the student record this is provided just for identification purposes and does n ot have any direct use english numeric the grade between and obtained in e nglish this will always be present three more numeric fields from among physics chemistry com puterscience hindi biology physicaleducation economics a the input for each record has the grade for all subjects opted by a student other than mathematics which you have to predict as the answer constraints lt n lt the serialnumber field will contain a unique numeric identifier such that lt serialnumber lt all other fields in the json fragment will represent the grades obtained in four subjects and will be populated by numeric values between and both inclusive output format for each student record that is given as a json object containing the grade obtained in four subjects output the predicted grade in mathematics this will be a numeral between and both inclusive in a newline training file and sample tests the training file with sample test data is available here the three files in this package are training json sample test in json sample test out json training data as well as sample testcases have been provided in the above file for offline training and to help you build your prediction model feel free to include file data inside your code sample input serialnumber english physics chemistry comp uterscience json object json object json object sample output explanation it is predicted that first candidate obtained grade in mathematics the second candidate achieved grade in mathematics the third candidate achieved grade in mathematics and so on scoring for each of the n records in the input file we will compute p abs predicted grade point in mathematics actual grade point in mathematics where abs indicates the absolute value or magnitude if p or your answer for that particular student record will be considered correct i e we allow a tolerance of one grade point away from the correct answer to take into consideration the marginal errors which might occur during the testing or grading process score c w n where c number of correct predictions not more than one grade point away from the actual grade point assigned w number of wrong incorrect predictions and n total number of records in the input while the contest is in progress only the score based on the sample test case will be displayed to you after the contest is completed we will revise the scores based on performance on a hidden test set only however when you make submissions you will be able to see whether your program attains a positive score on both the sample and the hidden test cases to avoid a situation where unexpected errors occur on the hidden test set at the end practo sde.given a string and array of strings find
